# custom-templates

***

## Description

This project contains NetBeans module with custom templates. These
templates are configured the way I like it and the way I think they
are a bit more modern than the default templates. However, these
my preference may be different than for others and hence I would
not propose them as defaults.

This project may also be an example of a simple module for NetBeans.
This module is created with for example annotations instead of 
layer.xml, arguably more modern than most examples available.

## Installation

1. Clone the project
2. Build the project
3. Run the project.

If the above three steps work, then you can do the final step.

4. In **Tools** menu select **Plugins**.
5. In the **Plugins** dialog, in the **Downloaded** tab, click **Add Plugin**.
6. Navigate to the *target* directory in the project directory and select the *.nbm file.
7. Back in the **Plugins** dialog, click **Install**.

That should be it.
